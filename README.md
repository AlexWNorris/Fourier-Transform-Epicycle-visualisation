# Fourier-Series-Epicycle-visualisation
This program uses the discrete Fourier Series to derive a collection of epicycles to draw a set of parsed coordinates 
which can therefore be used to draw any continues image

the FSAT file contains to implementations of the same thing. One being in exsponential form and the other in trigonometric form 
utilising the fact that re^ix = r(cos x+isin x)

see a video of the program in action here: https://youtu.be/5MW60XcRaEg

To retieve the coordiantaes for the image from the svg fille i used this webpage: https://spotify.github.io/coordinator/
the coordinate output from this webpage is then pasted into the textCoords folder and the path of the desired image
the path variable in the code should then be set to the desired image and the program is then ready to run!
