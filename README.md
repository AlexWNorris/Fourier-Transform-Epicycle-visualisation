# Fourier-Transformation-Epicycle-visualisation
This program uses the discrete Fourier transform to derive a series of epicycles to draw a set of parsed coordinates 
which can therefore be used to draw any continues image

see a video of the program in action here: https://youtu.be/5MW60XcRaEg

To retieve the coordiantaes for the image from the svg fille i used this webpage: https://spotify.github.io/coordinator/
the coordinate output from this webpage is then pasted into the textCoords folder and the path of the desired image
the path variable in the code should then be set to the desired image and the program is then ready to run!
